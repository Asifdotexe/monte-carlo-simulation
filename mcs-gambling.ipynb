    "## Scenario: Rolling a \"100-Sided Metaphorical Dice\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Outcome Range**: The user rolls a dice with possible outcomes ranging from 1 to 100.\n",
    "- **Winning Conditions**:\n",
    "  - If the user rolls between 1 and 50, the house wins.\n",
    "  - If the user rolls between 51 and 99, the user wins.\n",
    "  - If the user rolls a 100, the house wins.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **House Edge**: The house maintains a slight edge of 1% due to the rule that if the dice lands on 100, the house wins.\n",

    "### What is Gambler's Fallacy?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Gambler's Fallacy is a mistaken belief that if an event has occurred multiple times in a row, the opposite outcome is more likely to happen next. For example, if you flip a coin and it lands on heads five times in a row, you might instinctively feel that tails are \"due\" and more likely to come up next.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this belief is incorrect. The odds of flipping heads or tails remain 50/50 each time, regardless of previous outcomes. Each flip is independent, and past events do not influence future probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr>\n",

    "### How Monte Carlo Simulation Illustrates the Gambler's Fallacy\n",
    "\n",
    "Monte Carlo Simulation can be used to demonstrate the flaw in the Gambler's Fallacy by simulating multiple rolls of the dice. No matter how many times a particular outcome occurs, the probability of each specific outcome (in this case, the house or user winning) remains consistent with the defined rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Misconception**: Some gamblers may think that if the user wins several times in a row, the house is \"due\" for a win, and therefore the odds might shift in favor of the house.\n",
    "- **Reality**: The odds do not change based on previous outcomes. Each roll of the dice is independent, and the probability of the user winning remains the same as outlined, regardless of the results of previous rolls.\n",
    "\n",
    "This demonstrates how the Gambler's Fallacy is a cognitive bias rather than a reflection of actual probability."
