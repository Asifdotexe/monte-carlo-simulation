## What is Monte Carlo Simulation?
Monte Carlo simulation is a statistical technique used to understand the impact of risk and uncertainty in prediction and decision-making processes.

It involves running a large number of simulations to model the possible outcomes of a process or system by randomly varying input parameters according to their probability distributions.

The result gives a range of possible outcomes and their probabilities of different outcomes occuring, helping in decision-making under uncertainty

Mostly used in fields like financem engineering, and project management.
